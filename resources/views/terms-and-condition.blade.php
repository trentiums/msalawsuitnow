                <p>Arbitration</p>
                <p>In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or concerning
                    these Terms and Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or
                    in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by final and binding
                    arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and
                    administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the
                    parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator’s award shall be final, and
                    judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or
                    equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the
                    prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. The parties

                <p>Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an individual basis; class
                    arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A
                    PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
                    CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF
                    A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and Michael’s & Sterling
                    Consulting LLC agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and
