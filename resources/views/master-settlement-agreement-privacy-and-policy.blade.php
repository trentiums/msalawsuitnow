                <p>You may only make a verifiable CA User request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month
                    period. The verifiable CA User request must:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are: (1) the

                <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your
                    identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you.
                    Making a verifiable CA User request does not require that you create an account with us. We will
                    only use personal information provided in a verifiable CA User request to verify the requestor’s
                    identity or authority to make the request.</p>

                <p>Response Timing and Format</p>

                <p>We endeavor to respond to all verifiable CA User requests within forty-five (45) days of the receipt
                    thereof. If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and
                    extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your
                    option. Any disclosures that we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding the
                    receipt of your verifiable request. The response that we provide will also explain the reasons that
                    we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a
                    format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit
                    the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>

                <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable CA User request unless it is
                    excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we
                    will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your
                    request.</p>

                <p>Non-Discrimination</p>
